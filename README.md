# Cloud Network
This is a collection of Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts from my CyberClass.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with differnt docker containers.

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.

We have different availability zones now on the diagram and our ELK machine as well as the Jumpbox.
