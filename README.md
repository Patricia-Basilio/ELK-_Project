# Cloud Network
This is a collection of Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts from my CyberClass.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with differnt docker containers.

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.

We have different availability zones now on the diagram and our ELK machine as well as the Jumpbox. In the image the ELK machine has a container but it does not show on the diagram since we already have the ELK machine.
